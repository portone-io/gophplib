/*
gophplib is a collection of PHP functions implemented in Go. We aim to achieve
100% byte-to-byte bug-to-bug behavioral equivalence with the original PHP
functions.

Currently we do not intend to implement all PHP functions, but only those that
are useful for our projects.

# References

The following works were consulted but not used because they do not provide
behavior that is 100% compatible with the PHP version.
